AI2Agent is an end-to-end framework designed to transform AI projects into autonomous agents, enhancing both automation and reusability in deployment. Unlike traditional DevOps approaches, which often rely on manual configurations or static templates, AI2Agent integrates intelligent reasoning, automated debugging, and iterative experience accumulation to provide efficient and adaptable AI deployment solutions.

The framework initiates a structured execution process based on user requests, such as generating content in a specific style, which includes searching for suitable projects and following predefined guidelines for execution, auto-deployment, and debugging to ensure successful outcomes. 

Despite its strengths in automation and adaptability, there remains potential for further refinement, especially as AI projects increase in complexity. The authors encourage collaboration from researchers and practitioners to contribute to the evolution of AI2Agent, expanding its capabilities and applications.
